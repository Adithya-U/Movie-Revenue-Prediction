# Movie Revenue Prediction with Multilinear Regression


## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for a movie revenue prediction system built using a Multilinear Regression machine learning model. The model is trained on the IMDb 5000 dataset from Kaggle to predict the revenue generated by a movie based on various features.

## Features

- Multilinear Regression model for movie revenue prediction.
- IMDb 5000 dataset for training and testing.
- Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model training.

## Dependencies

To run the revenue prediction system and explore the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:



## Dataset

The IMDb 5000 dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [IMDb 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). You will need to download and place the dataset in the `data/` directory of this repository.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model training:

5. Open and run the provided Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and train the Multilinear Regression model.


## How the Revenue Prediction System Works

The revenue prediction system uses a Multilinear Regression model that takes into account various movie features (such as budget, director, and actors) to predict the revenue a movie is likely to generate. You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook to load your own movie data and make revenue predictions.
